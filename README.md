Stateless Authentication and Authorization Express, Mongoose, Passport, JWT, node-acl written in ES6

## Requirements
- [Node.js]("https://nodejs.org/") >= 8.x
- [MongoDB]("https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/")

## Configuration
### server/config/config.js
To establish a connection to the database, you may configure the database connection parameters in the global configuration 
file. Dfault is mongodb://localhost:27017/jwtpassauth.

## Authentication
### server/config/authenticate.js
Authentication is based on [json web tokens]("https://jwt.io") and passwort-jwt.
After a successful login the generated token is sent to the requester. To access the protected routes, the requester must sent the token in the header request.

## JWT Secret
The JWT secret key is set in the global configuration file. Edit them to suit your needs.
The JWT contains encoded information about the user and a signature that, when decoded, is validated to ensure that the token has not been tampered with.
